\chapter{Conclusion}
%The degree of stability exhibited by both systems across experiments is a result of the constant, periodic climatic conditions used in the simulations and will most decidedly not be found in natural ecosystems, which are prone to variable environmental and anthropogenic stressors. 
%The goal of this study was to investigate biodiversity effects (i.e. loss of a functional group) on ecosystem functioning on larger temporal and spatial scales than attempted before, while illustrating the potential of a general ecosystem model and cross-ecosystem comparisons. In this light, a number of insights were generated, and potential new lines of research to explore identified.\\\\
A need for studies elucidating the role of biodiversity for ecosystem functioning and structure in systems of natural complexity has been expressed repeatedly \citep[e.g.][]{Hooper2012,Naeem2012,Tilman2014}.\\\\
Here, a relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, that was previously identified in small-scale or short-term experiments, has been successfully reproduced using a general ecosystem model providing high degrees of complexity at adequate scale:
Functional group composition, more precisely the presence of ectothermic, iteroparous carnivores, was shown to govern individual (average body mass) and community level (abundance density)  properties of herbivores, and thereby effected an ecosystem level response (biomass density) for autotrophs in a highly productive, aseasonal system. While functional richness (number of groups present) also had an effect, the dominance of a single functional group for governing ecosystem functioning was striking.  \\
In addition, the potential existence of a climatically driven mechanism in seasonal environments, where functional group composition alters ecosystem structure, rather than functioning, 
%by redistributing biomass within trophic groups 
was highlighted and begs further investigation.\\
Including dispersal between adjacent grid cells, as well as tracking changes in size distributions within a functional group, offer great moments of motivation to elaborate on findings presented here. 
\\\\
The findings, and general usefulness of the model presented here, indicate a number of potential applications for conservation, where management of ecosystem services is likely to benefit more.
\\\\
In conclusion, the most exciting feature of the \textsc{Madingley Model} may not be to test existing hypothesis, but to generate new questions. Or, even more so in the light of biodiversity loss \citep{Ceballos2015, Urban2015}, to answer them before they turn into grave problems for society and generations to come.
