Community level (abundance density) and individual (average body mass) properties govern the response of a trophic group on ecosystem level (biomass density), and thereby ecosystem functioning. 
That is, the ecosystem level property considered here will only be affected when changes in average body mass coincide with an appropriate directional shift of overall abundance in the respective trophic group (e.g. heavier organisms at higher abundances mean higher body mass densities)
