\chapter{Results}
\label{chap:res}
Two ecosystems of distinct climatic character (i.e. equatorial, aseasonal and temperate, seasonal) were simulated over 100 years for different levels of carnivore functional group richness and composition (cf. Section~\ref{chap:mat:exp}). Resulting ecosystem functioning, expressed as biomass density on trophic level, are presented and related to population and individual level dynamics in the following sections.

\section{Temporal Dynamics}
\label{chap:res:dyn:temporal}

%Overall dynamics are more strongly governed by climatic conditions in the temperate, seasonal ecosystem, whereas carnivore group composition dictates ecosystem functioning more pronouncedly for the aseasonal ecosystem 

As expected, biomass densities in the temperate ecosystem follow seasonal cycles.
 Annual turn-over reaches up to one order of magnitude for autotrophs, while less, but pronounced, variation is found for herbivores.
  Omnivores and carnivores closely follow these cycles at lower biomass densities (respective order; cf. Figure~\ref{fig:chap:res:dyn:cell1}). \\
  The aseasonal system is generally characterized by more stable biomass densities over time, related to variation resulting from random organismal interactions encoded in the model, as opposed than cyclical dynamics in the seasonal system. 
  \textit{Exp. 4, 6, 7} and \textit{8} digress from this pattern, showing recurring cycles for autotroph and carnivore (where applicable) biomass densities, but far less systematic and pronounced (lower turnover) than found for the seasonal system. 
(cf. Figure~\ref{fig:chap:res:ts:expno1} and \add{fig. Cell1 Cell0 compare  + all TS APPENDIX}).\\
Both systems display drastic changes in median biomass density within their transient ("burn-in") phase within the first 15 to 25 and 10 years of the simulations, respectively, for all trophic groups (cf. Figure~\ref{fig:chap:res:ts:expno1}; exemplary). 
Subsequently, the systems develop towards a dynamic equilibrium. 
Autotroph and carnivore  biomass density in \textit{exp. 2} and \textit{exp. 5}, respectively, show slight trends over the last 50 years of the simulation. 
However, when applying the 90 year cut-off (used for subsequent analysis) these are negligible \add{appendix figure, all TS}.\\\\

Median autotroph biomass ($[kg\cdot km^{-2}]$) and herbivore abundance ($[n\cdot km^{-2}$]) densities were compared between experiments (1 to 8) using a Krusikal-Wallis test with subsequent multiple comparison analysis (\add{adjusted p value?} $\alpha = 0.05$; cf. Table~\ref{tab:chap:res:dyn:autoBMD} and Table~\ref{tab:chap:res:dyn:herbIND}, respectively). 
Experiments (i.e. their mean ranks) differed significantly in biomass density response only for the aseasonal  system ($\chi^{2}(7) = 783.67$, $p \ll 0.05$). 
% seasonal  \add{adjusted p value?}($\chi^{2}(7) = 191.66$, $p \ll 0.05$) system.
\\
For abundance densities, significant differences between experiments were found for both the aseasonal ($\chi^{2}(7) = 834.34$, $p \ll 0.05$) and seasonal ($\chi^{2}(7) = 191.66$, $p \ll 0.05$) system. 
Note, the sampled experiments could not be considered having originated from identical distributions (cf.~Figure \add{HISTOGRAMS OF HERB. DENSITY ~ EXPNO in Appendix}); 
hence inferences base on mean ranks, rather than systematic shifts of central tendency (i.e. median) Figure~\add{Barplot BMD IDENS Densities}.
