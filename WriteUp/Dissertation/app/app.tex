\chapter{Supplemental materials}
A data storage medium containing all raw data and necessary analyses to reproduce the results presented in the main body of the dissertation is attached. \\
On the storage, there are three main directories. One contains the \textsc{Madingley Model} (Folder: "Model")in its version used for the simulations here, one all of the analyses (Folder: "Analyses"), and one contains all supplemental material from \cite{Harfoot2014} for the analyses as well as the model parameters used for the simulations (Folder: "Supplemental Material").

Note, that \textit{exp. 8} is not displayed due to zero values. Seeding biomass density may have had decisive effect for equilibrium conditions.}
